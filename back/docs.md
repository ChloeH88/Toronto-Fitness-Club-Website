## 1. All Postman API can be found at `postman.json` file.

## 2. Django models
Please refer to `tfc_models.png` for our model diagram.
Written explanation:
- 1 model in `accounts` app:
  - `User` model: general information about a registered user.

- 3 models in `studios` app:
  - `Studio` model: general info about a studio, and it has one-to-many relationship to `Image` and `Amenity` model -- since a studio can have multiple images and amenities.

- 4 models in `classes` app:
  -  `BaseKlass` model: general info about a class (like start and end date, class name, in which studio), and we have another model `KlassInstance` that contains every weekly instance of `BaseKlass`.
  - `Enrolled` model stores every user's enrollment to every `KlassInstance`
  - `CancelledKlassInstance` stores `KlassInstance` that are cancelled.

- 4 models in `subscriptions` app
    - `SubscriptionPlan` model contains gym's all plans, each with its price and billing cycle.
    - `UserSubscription` model contains info about user subscribes to which plan. (user can only subscribe to one plan, so one-to-one relation to `User` model)
    - `UserCard` model is one-to-one to user, contains user's current payment card.
    - `UserPaymentHistory` contains user's every past payment.
## 3. Admin Page Instruction
### Class
<!-- If you check the box `add_all_instances`, it'll create all class instances between `start_date` and `end_date`. -->

1. Create classes that recur between start and end date:
   <!-- â€¢ Remember to **check `add_all_instance` checkbox** -->
   â€¢ **No need to enter information in `Class Instance` section.**
   â€¢ After save, go back to this page, and you'll see all class instances that are auto-generated.

2. Cancel one class instance:
    <!-- â€¢ **uncheck `add_all_instance` checkbox** -->
    â€¢ Delete it from `Class Instance` section.
    â€¢ You can see it in `Cancelled Class Instance` section.

3. Cancel all future occurrence of a class:
    â€¢ Modify `end_date` in `Class` section on top

Note: If you change a class's `start_date`, `start_time`, `end_time`, **all cancelled classes will be removed, and you have to manually cancel classes again** -- because as a not very intelligent server, I'm not sure if you want to bring back a cancelled class if you change date/time.

4. Bring back a cancelled class instance:
   â€¢ Ensure `end_date` in `Class` section on top is after this class instance date
   â€¢ Delete the cancelled class from `Cancelled Class Instance` section
   â€¢ save

### Others
Other admin pages are pretty straightforward, please follow format in help text to enter information.

## 5. Payment Script
`sh run_today_payment.sh` is the command to pay all users that have a payment due date today. 

But because first payment is paid immediately after submission, all users' next payment will be at least one month later. 

In interview, we can change code in our file (let today = a future date), and show how to run the script to pay for users that due on that future date.
